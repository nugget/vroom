VROOM - Road Trip backup file toolkit

This is Tcl and PostgreSQL code I use to process backup files from the Road
Trip iPhone app by Darren Stone.

The iPhone app uses email to send CSV backups of its data file to an email
address.  I capture those emails as they arrive (via procmail) and parse them
with this code and dump the data into a pgsql database.

This is the data back end I use to publish the data on my website.
